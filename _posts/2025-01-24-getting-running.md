Starting the year right :) But also, maybe not. I'm not sure why I picked github pages to make this but I [ragrat](https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&url=https%3A%2F%2Fagitator.thedonorvoice.com%2Fno-ragrets%2F&psig=AOvVaw11BEVxBKgHCOEKBRkqVJWt&ust=1737836175302000&source=images&cd=vfe&opi=89978449&ved=0CBEQjRxqFwoTCPjsp7GWj4sDFQAAAAAdAAAAABAS) my decision. 

The main selling points :
- easy to use
- jekyll
- quick

What actually happened :
- Annoying to use
- WHAT ARE THESE THEMES?? I just opted to use css
- took me longer to get right than i care to admit

Anyway, this sets the tone for what I'm going to write about. Nothing majorly introspective, profound or really entertaining (see drivel). Nevertheless, hoping to show off some cool projects, thoughts, places etc. 

Food, music, events fashion, food, coding, food, food, food and other cool stuff I see.
